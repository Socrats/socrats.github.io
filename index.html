        <h1>Social Dynamics and Evolutionary Game Theory</h1>
        <p>This tutorial at <a href="https://ecai2023.eu">ECAI 2023</a> will provide an overview of the Evolutionary
            Game Theory (EGT) field with emphasis on its
            applicability to characterize hybrid human-AI multi-agent systems. We will introduce the main research
            questions and practical challenges of implementing EGT models.

                        <h3>Presenter: Elias Fernández Domingos</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Classical game theory typically analyzes interactions between two (or a few) players and aims to
                        answer how each individual can maximize their utility. Such a question, from a mathematical
                        perspective, becomes very intricate and complex as a player must consider the utilities of all
                        other players and any possible set of beliefs. Thus, following the famous work of Nash, it is
                        often assumed that all players act in a way that maximizes their utility and believe that others
                        will do the same. This simplifies the analysis and transforms it into a search for the points of
                        equilibrium at which no player has any incentive to change its strategy (Nash equilibrium). This
                        assumption requires that players have perfect knowledge about the game/environment and is
                        referred to as rationality. Yet, it is often cumbersome to assume that individuals are rational
                        in many social and biological systems, even in simple pairwise interactions. Moreover, whenever
                        the problem requires a proper understanding of conflicts occurring in large populations, it
                        becomes necessary to characterize the choices and strategies of many individuals throughout
                        time, and not only at equilibrium. As such, in many real-world multi-agent systems, the goal is
                        shifted towards the understanding of the complex ecologies of behaviors emerging from a given
                        dilemma (or "game"). This is where evolutionary game theory (EGT) shines as a theoretical and
                        computational framework.</p>
                    <p>
                        In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the students to the main models used in EGT and offer an
                        overview of the research in the field, with an emphasis on its applicability to characterize
                        hybrid human-AI multi-agent systems both when considering unstructured (well-mixed) populations,
                        as well as structured populations, whose interaction structure is organized into a Complex
                        Network4. Moreover, we will pay special attention to the computational approaches to EGT, by
                        summarizing the practical challenges of implementing the numerical and agent-based simulations
                        required to model large-scale systems.

                    <p>Elias is currently a Postdoctoral researcher (FNRS fellow) at the ULB - Brussels. He is
                        interested in the origins of cooperation in social interactions and how can we maintain it in an
                        increasingly complex and hybrid human-AI world. In his research he applies concepts and methods
                        from (Evolutionary) Game Theory, Behavioural economics and Machine Learning to model collective
                        (strategic) behaviour and validate it through behavioural economic experiments. Additionally,
                        he is the creator of <a href="https://github.com/Socrats/EGTTools">EGTtools</a> a Python/C++
                        toolbox for Evolutionary Game Theory.

                    <p>The importance of AI in social ecosystems, and particularly, its effect on human cooperation and
                        fairness, has gained increasing attention. Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) provides a powerful
                        methodological framework for the study of the evolution of cooperation in large populations.
                        Yet, the AI and EGT research communities rarely engage. We believe the present tutorial will
                        raise awareness of the importance of EGT for social cooperative AI and introduce methods of
                        large relevance for AI researchers in this field. </p>

                        <li>Motivate and explain a topic of emerging importance for AI

                        <li>Provide instructions in established but specialized AI methodologies</li>
                        <li>Introduce AI audience to an external topic that can motivate or use AI research</li>
